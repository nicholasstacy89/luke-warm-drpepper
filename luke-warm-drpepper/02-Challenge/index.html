                    <p>Hello, my name is Nicholas and this is my work in progress portfolio for the coding bootcamp.  I will be reworking and adding new projects as the bootcamp continous and I learn more skills to add to this page.  Here is an excerpt from <span id="book">Moby-Dick by Herman Melville</span> </p>
                        <div>
                        <p>Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no
                        money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would
                        sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the
                        spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the
                        mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself
                        involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every
                        funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it
                        requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the
                        street, and methodically knocking people's hats off—then, I account it high time to get to
                        sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical
                        flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing
                        surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other,
                        cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.
                        There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as
                        Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the
                        streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is the battery, where that noble mole
                        is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight
                        of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.
                        Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook
                        to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you see?—Posted
                        like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men
                        fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pierheads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the
                        rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of
                        week days pent up in lath and plaster—tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to
                        desks. How then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here?</p>
